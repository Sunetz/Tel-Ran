                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1976</strong> - Mir was authorised by a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved model of the Salyut DOS-17K space stations</li>
                    <li><strong>1978</strong> - Mir had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station</li>
                    <li><strong>1984</strong> - work on Mir had halted while all resources were being put into the Buran programme in order to prepare the Buran spacecraft for flight testing. </li>
                    <li><strong>1986</strong> - The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.</li>
                    <li><strong>1987</strong> - Kvant-1 module to be launched. Scientific equipment included an X-ray telescope, an ultraviolet telescope, a wide-angle camera, high-energy X-ray experiments, an X-ray/gamma ray detector, and the Svetlana electrophoresis unit. The module also carried six gyrodynes for attitude control, in addition to life support systems including an Elektron oxygen generator and a Vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubber</li>
                    <li><strong>1989</strong> - Kvant-2 module to be launched. The module also carried a Soviet version of the Manned Maneuvering Unit for the Orlan space suit, referred to as Ikar, a system for regenerating water from urine, a shower, the Rodnik water storage system and six gyrodynes to augment those already located in Kvant-1. Scientific equipment included a high-resolution camera, spectrometers, X-ray sensors, the Volna 2 fluid flow experiment, and the Inkubator-2 unit, which was used for hatching and raising quail.</li>
                    <li><strong>1990</strong> - Kristall module to be launched. The docking compartment also contained the Priroda 5 camera used for Earth resources experiments. Kristall also carried six control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or "gyrodynes") for attitude control to augment those already on the station, and two collapsible solar arrays.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Spektr module to be launched. The module was designed for remote observation of Earth's environment and contained atmospheric and surface research equipment. It featured four solar arrays which generated approximately half of the station's electrical power. The module also had a science airlock to expose experiments to the vacuum of space selectively. Spektr was rendered unusable following the collision with Progress M-34 in 1997 which damaged the module, exposing it to the vacuum of space.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Docking Module to be launched. </li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - Priroda Module to be launched. The module's experiments were provided by twelve different nations, and covered microwave, visible, near infrared, and infrared spectral regions using both passive and active sounding methods. The module possessed both pressurised and unpressurised segments, and featured a large, externally mounted synthetic aperture radar dish. </li>
                    <li><strong>2001</strong> - The Mir space Station was flooded in the Pacific Ocean on March 23, 2001 due to the obsolescence of equipment and lack of financial resources for its maintenance</li>
